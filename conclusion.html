        <h5 id="h5"> CONCLUSION</h5>
       <p style=" color:black ; background-color: magenta; font-size: larger;"> All in all my biggest challenge has been me joining the classes late as my work ends at 6:00pm and the classes start 
        at 5:30pm.It has been difficult to follow through too as you be exhausted and it gets worse when the recordings are uploaded
        late. Thus you go i nto the next class abit frustrated.Scheduling time to balance between work and class has been 
        difficult but I adjusted and am now progressing steadily.
        Nevertheless I have been able to catch up using the recordings which gives me some satisfaction. </p>
